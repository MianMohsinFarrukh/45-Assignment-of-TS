// 26 --- Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
// 1• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

// 2• If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.




// 1• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

let alien_color: string = "green";
if (alien_color === "green") {
    console.log("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.")
} else {
    console.log("Congratulations! You just earned 10 points.")
};








// 2• If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

let alien: string = "red";
if (alien === "green") {
    console.log("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.")
} else {
    console.log("Congratulations! You just earned 10 points.")
};
